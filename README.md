## Multi Part Forms:
When adding a file input field to a form, we'll need to adjust the form's attributes to include the enctype.

	<form action="/" method="POST" entype="multipart/form-data">
		<input type="file" accept="image/*" name="photo">
	</form>
	
I also added the accept attribute to the form.  If the server doesn't accept the file type the user selects, the file will be ignored.

Soâ€¦What does this do?

Changes your Content-Type header:

	Content-Type:multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundaryLqxk62ALAzpDVmHg
	
It also effects the way the form is transferred to the server:

	------WebKitFormBoundaryLqxk62ALAzpDVmHg
	Content-Disposition: form-data; name="user[name]"

	Dave Hoover
	------WebKitFormBoundaryLqxk62ALAzpDVmHg
	Content-Disposition: form-data; name="user[photo]"; filename="dave.png"
	Content-Type: image/png


	------WebKitFormBoundaryLqxk62ALAzpDVmHg--
	
When the form is submitted, it will read in the data and submit it to the server, where a new file will be created.
